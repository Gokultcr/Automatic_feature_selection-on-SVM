## Automatic Feature Selection using Ant Colony Optimization (ACO)

This script demonstrates the application of Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) for feature selection in a machine learning pipeline. 

1. **Data Preprocessing**: 
    - Images of different tree species are loaded and features are extracted using GLCM (Gray Level Co-occurrence Matrix).
    - The data is split into training, validation, and testing sets.

2. **Feature Selection with ACO**:
    - ACO algorithm is applied to select an optimal subset of features.
    - The algorithm iteratively selects features based on pheromone levels and heuristic information.
    - Parameters like the number of ants, alpha, beta, and evaporation rate are set to guide the search.

3. **Model Training and Evaluation**:
    - Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier is trained using the selected features.
    - Performance is evaluated on the training, validation, and testing sets.
    - Accuracy and classification reports are generated for each set.

### Code Explanation:

#### Data Preprocessing:
- The script loads images of different tree species and extracts features using GLCM.
- Images are resized to a standard size (`SIZE = 200`) before feature extraction.
- Features extracted include Energy, Dissimilarity, Homogeneity, and Contrast.

#### Feature Selection with ACO:
- ACO class is defined to perform feature selection.
- The ACO algorithm iteratively selects features based on pheromone levels and heuristic information.
- Parameters like `num_ants`, `alpha`, `beta`, `evaporation_rate`, and `q0` are set to control the behavior of the algorithm.

#### Model Training and Evaluation:
- Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier is trained using the selected features.
- Performance is evaluated using accuracy metrics and classification reports.
- Separate evaluations are done for training, validation, and testing sets.

### Results:
- The script provides insights into the performance of the ACO-based feature selection method.
- It allows comparison of accuracy and classification reports for different sets.
- The feature importance is visualized through a bar plot of SVM coefficients.

### Further Improvements:
- Hyperparameters of ACO and SVM can be fine-tuned for better performance.
- Other feature selection techniques like Genetic Algorithms or Recursive Feature Elimination can be explored.
